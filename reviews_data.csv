Waste of money!,"Actually,the is flickering with multifarious colurs especially right half of the screen",5, Jalandhar,Flipkart Customer,2 months ago
Just okay,Phone is just okay. Camera not good at the price(night mode looks too much processed). Performance is good. Display is fine but too much saturated and does not look natural. No SD card slot.I found Motorola display better and also stock Android on Moto is great. If there is Moto with good cameras then I would recommend that over Redmi(moto phones like g82 have poor camera).,4, Pune,Vishal Khandelwal,2 months ago

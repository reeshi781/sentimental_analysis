I installed gcam. But the photo rendering is not good in gcam. I think it will work better with Snapdragon chipset.So,  I prefer stock camera for photography.

It's battery performance is not good according to 5000 mah battery because my previous phone also had 5000 mah battery which gives me around 9 hour backup after using all day but this mobile Redmi Note 12 Pro 5g is giving me only around 4 to 5 hours of backup.
